# FaceFinder Frontend

## Overview

This web app was created as a personal project to explore full-stack React apps utilizing a REST API, Clarifai, creating a server (via Express.js) and using a PostgreSQL database to store user data

## Features

- Allows the user to sign in and/or register
- Uses bcrypt to securely hash passwords
- Once the user is signed in, they can input an image link in the form which will render the image (if a valid url) with a bounding box around the face(s) in the image
- Connects with Clarifaiâ€™s face-detection model API to provide the bounding box
- Tells the user how many faces were found in their image
